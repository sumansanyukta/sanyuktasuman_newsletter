    <p class="text-4xl font-heading font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Weekly Overview:</p>
    <p class="font-body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">Welcome to my weekly roundup! This past week marked the start of my unemployment adventure (yes, I'm framing it positively), and it's been a whirlwind of growth, challenges, and exciting pivots. From revamping my online presence to diving into certifications and interview prep, here's what kept me buzzing:</p>
    <p class="font-body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify"><strong>Highlights:</strong></p>
    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>Rebuilding my portfolio website with a newsletter and blog focus</li>
        <li>Started my Google Cloud Machine Learning Engineering Certification</li>
        <li>Practiced SQL interview questions from Strata Scratch</li>
        <li>Began freelancing as a Data Scientist</li>
        <li>Discovered inspiring people this week</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="font-body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">Let's dive into the detailsâ€”I'll share the highs, the hurdles, and the lessons learned along the way.</p>

    <h2 class="font-heading text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-5 mt-8 text-left">Rebuilding My Portfolio Website</h2>
    <p class="font-body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">I've been tinkering with my website since 2019, redesigning it more times than I can count. It's evolved from a simple portfolio to an art gallery, a Looker Studio demo hub, and even a short-lived online shop for my artwork. Now, I'm giving it a new lease on life as a dedicated portfolio site, complete with weekly blog posts chronicling my quest for that dream job in data science.</p>
    <p class="font-body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">This is my first full week of unemployment, and honestly, I've packed it so full of thrilling projects that "free time" feels like a myth. But that's the beauty of this phaseâ€”it's all about reinvention. When I decided to reshape my site's identity, I started by exploring how to integrate my Notion notes into my existing Wix setup. Embedding via iframes seemed promising at first, but it quickly fell flat: the pages looked clunky, editing control was minimal, and the design options just didn't vibe with my vision.</p>
    <p class="font-body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">That's when it hit meâ€”building a website from scratch doesn't have to be a time-sink anymore, especially with AI tools in my corner. Why settle for compromises when I could take full control and craft something simple, intuitive, and totally me?</p>

    <h3 class="font-heading text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4 mt-6 text-left">Crafting a Cohesive Brand Identity</h3>
    <p class="font-body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">To guide this process, I turned to Perplexity AI for inspirationâ€”it helped me refine my vague ideas into a polished plan. I had a theme in mind but struggled to document it cohesively. Picture this: a 1970s retro pop art aesthetic, infused with soothing matcha greens and buttery yellows. It felt right for my creative, data-driven personality.</p>
    <p class="font-body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">I leaned on my go-to tools to bring it to life:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li><a href="https://www.canva.com/en_gb/" class="text-brand-green underline hover:text-brand-green/80"><strong>Canva</strong></a>: Packed with brand identity templates, it's a lifesaver for kickstarting projects without starting from zero.</li>
        <li><a href="https://coolors.co/" class="text-brand-green underline hover:text-brand-green/80"><strong>Coolors.com,</strong></a> <a href="https://www.color-hex.com/" class="text-brand-green underline hover:text-brand-green/80"><strong>color-hex.com</strong></a>: Perfect for generating and tweaking color palettes, often sparked by quick Google searches.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.dafont.com/de/" class="text-brand-green underline hover:text-brand-green/80"><strong>dafont.com,</strong></a> <a href="https://fonts.google.com//" class="text-brand-green underline hover:text-brand-green/80"><strong>googlefont.com</strong></a>: I adore the playful 'Bright' font from Dafont and the clean 'Outfit' from Google Fonts.</li>
        <li><strong>Google searches</strong> for icons to add that final pop.</li>
        
    </ul>
    <p class="font-body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">After about five hours of experimenting and iterating, I landed on a setup that feels just right. Here's a sneak peek!.</p>
    <img src="/image/assets/brand_identity_col.jpg" alt="Placeholder image of a vibrant website design concept, showcasing a 1970s retro pop art aesthetic with matcha greens and buttery yellows." class="rounded-lg shadow-md my-6">
    <p class="font-body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">With the branding sorted, I was pumped to build the portfolio itself. My vision? A homepage leading to a blog landing page and individual blog posts. Before I start with writing code on VS Code, I set up Gemini Code Assist to help me tweak the design and polish the overall vibe of my website.</p>
    <p class="font-body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">If you're curious, check out this quick video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiqxoBYr6wM" class="text-brand-green underline hover:text-brand-green/80">How to Use Gemini AI in VS Code</a>. It's been a game-changer, turning what could have been a daunting task into an easy to debug the whole process and taking control of the situation.</p>

    <h2 class="font-heading text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-5 mt-8 text-left">Kicking Off My Google Cloud Machine Learning Engineering Certification</h2>
    <p class="font-body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">Building on last week's Python refresh, I powered through the full W3Schools curriculum this week. Sure, I dabbled in Python during my master's program, but my recent jobs haven't touched it, leaving me a bit rusty. Getting back in the groove felt like reuniting with an old friend.</p>
    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-brand-green pl-4 italic text-gray-600 mb-4">Pro tip: Don't get stuck in basics overload. Warm up with the essentials, then dive into real projects. Tutorials are like a coach's playbook, but you won't build muscle without getting your hands dirty. It's the same in sports: all the theory in the world means nothing without practice!</blockquote>
    <p class="font-body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">This week also highlighted my career shift from data analyst to data scientist. I dedicated a full day to revamping my resume for DS roles, even though my background leans more toward analytics and engineering. As I kick off my first data science gigs (more on that in a future post!), I researched certifications to bridge the gap. The winner? <a href="https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/machine-learning-engineer" class="text-brand-green underline hover:text-brand-green/80">Google Cloud Professional Machine Learning Engineering certificate.</a></p>
    <p class="font-body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">Why this one? I'm already comfortable with Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and my freelance project uses it too. It's a respected credential that demands real commitmentâ€”think rigorous prep and a $200 exam fee. To hold myself accountable, I booked my exam date right away. This isn't just a checkbox; it's a stepping stone to proving my skills in a competitive field. Stay tuned as I share progress and tips.</p>

    <h3 class="font-heading text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4 mt-6 text-left">Sharpening My Skills: Practicing SQL Interview Questions on StrataScratch</h3>
    <p class="font-body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">Let's be real: Landing that dream job means acing the interview gauntlet. For my last role, a case study introduced me to Looker Studio (instant love affair!), but top companies throw in intense technical rounds. I've dodged this challenge before, but no moreâ€”it's time to conquer the mountain. My plan? Tackle five problems daily on StrataScratch, a platform tailored for data-focused interviews.</p>
    <p class="font-body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">With three years of SQL under my belt, I figured it'd be smooth sailing. Spoiler: It wasn't. I hit unfamiliar problem types that left me stumped at first, reminding me that "hard" often just means "unfamiliar." Once you crack the logic, it clicksâ€”and that's the thrill.</p>
    <p class="font-body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">I initially eyed the LeetCode 150 grind (tech folks, you know the drill), but then it dawned on me: As a data scientist, my world revolves around ML concepts and SQL logic, not heavy data structures and algorithms (that's more for software devs). Enter StrataScratchâ€”a LeetCode-style site built specifically for data pros. It's been a revelation, helping me focus on what matters most for my goals. If you're prepping too, give it a try; it's sharpening my edge one question at a time.</p>

    <h2 class="font-heading text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-5 mt-8 text-left">Launching My Freelance Journey as a Data Scientist</h2>
    <p class="font-body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">Tying right into my GCP certification push, I feel incredibly fortunate to have landed my first freelance gig as a data scientist this week. I'm collaborating with a data firm. They've entrusted me with building an end-to-end ML pipeline to uncover strategies for increasing revenueâ€”exactly the kind of high-impact work I've been craving. It's a golden opportunity to apply my data expertise to real business problems, and it's already accelerating my transition into data science.</p>
    <p class="font-body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">Of course, no exciting project comes without its hurdles, and this one threw a few curveballs my way. The first big task? Importing Shopify data into BigQuery. As someone who's more analyst than engineer, this was uncharted territory, but I rolled up my sleeves and experimented until I cracked it.</p>
    <p class="font-body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">Here's how the adventure unfolded:</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>I hunted for a direct connection, like BigQuery's seamless link to Google Ads, but no luckâ€”Shopify doesn't play that nicely out of the box.</li>
        <li>Next, I tried Compute Engine instance with Airbyte, but ran into stubborn access token errors. Even after validating them in Postman, the issues persistedâ€”frustrating, but a great lesson in debugging.</li>
        <li>Finally, I pivoted to Python scripting, a tool I've shied away from in the past. It turned out to be the winner, getting the job done efficiently.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="font-body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">If you're tackling something similar, check out this handy <a href="/guides/A_Developer's_Guide_to_a_Shopify_to_BigQuery_Data_Sync.html" class="text-brand-green underline hover:text-brand-green/80">guide on connecting Shopify with BigQuery</a>.</p>
    <p class="font-body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">Once the data was in BigQuery (cue the victory dance!), I moved on to preprocessing and modeling, normalizing columns to set up a solid foundation. To keep everything streamlined, I'm managing the workflow in GitHub with CI/CD pipelinesâ€”connecting VS Code directly to GCP for running SQL queries and pushing updates.</p>
    <p class="font-body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">There was a learning curve here too, especially linking Dataform to GitHub. If you're a freelancer dealing with external repos, this <a href="/guides/A_Complete_Beginner's_Guide_to_Connecting_Dataform_to_GitHub.html" class="text-brand-green underline hover:text-brand-green/80">guide to connecting Dataform to GitHub</a> will be your lifesaver</p>
    <p class="font-body text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">Looking ahead, I'll be prepping the data as features for modeling in the coming days. Next week, the fun ramps up with creating customer personas to optimize Google Ads targeting. If you're on a similar path, stay tuned for more insightsâ€”this gig is proving that persistence pays off in spades!</p>
